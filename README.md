## General info
Money trackers are usually very feature-rich applications but that means that they can be quite complicated to use for some people, like those with mental disabilities.

This project was started on request of a family member of someone with a disability who cannot really grasp most (not to mention all) money trackers due the reason mentioned above.

As such, this is an attempt to develop an application that provides only the basics: tracking simple money transactions like payments and receiving money in a simple monthly overview with very few steps to use it.

## Screenshots
There are no screenshots available yet. The first screens must still be designed.

## Technologies

* .NET Framework 4.8
* VB.Net
* MS Test v2
* Windows Forms

The choice of technology comes down to 2 reasons: the first, the person for which the application is written, uses Windows.
And secondly, the choice for VB.Net is basically to use the development as a kind of an intellectual exercise to see whether the language is really that bad as many claim.

Windows Forms might be a strange decision to make regarding GUI technology. However, Forms is a very easy and simple way to start creating the application screens. Later on when more progress is made on the development of the application, most likely a switch will be made to a different GUI technology, probably something WPF based.

## Setup
Install instructions will be added here when the application development is progressed a little bit further.

## Features
All needed features are still in development.

To-do list:
* Listing all money transactions by month.
* Adding, editing and removing transactions.
* Recode the UI using the MVC pattern.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_.
